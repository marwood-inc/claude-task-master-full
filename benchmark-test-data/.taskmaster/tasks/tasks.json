        "details": "Implement TTS functionality including:\n- Add --tts flag to all relevant taskmaster commands (list, show, generate, etc.)\n- Integrate with system TTS engines (Windows SAPI, macOS say command, Linux espeak/festival)\n- Create TTS configuration options in the configuration management system\n- Add voice selection options (male/female, different languages if available)\n- Implement audio output settings (volume, speed, pitch)\n- Add TTS-specific error handling for cases where TTS is unavailable\n- Create fallback behavior when TTS fails (silent failure or text output)\n- Support for reading task titles, descriptions, and status updates aloud\n- Add option to read entire task lists or individual task details\n- Implement TTS for command confirmations and error messages\n- Create TTS output formatting to make spoken text more natural (removing markdown, formatting numbers/dates appropriately)\n- Add configuration option to enable/disable TTS globally\n<info added on 2025-06-14T21:55:53.499Z>\nAdd comprehensive testing strategy for TTS functionality:\n\n**TTS Testing Requirements:**\n- Test TTS flag functionality across all commands (list, show, generate) with various voice configurations\n- Validate TTS engine integration on different platforms (Windows SAPI, macOS say, Linux espeak/festival)\n- Test voice selection options and audio output settings (volume, speed, pitch) with edge cases\n- Verify TTS error handling when engines are unavailable or fail\n- Test fallback behavior scenarios (silent failure vs text output)\n- Validate TTS output formatting for natural speech (markdown removal, number/date pronunciation)\n- Test global TTS enable/disable configuration settings\n- Verify TTS works correctly with task titles, descriptions, and status updates of varying lengths and complexity\n- Test TTS performance with large task lists and individual task details\n- Validate TTS for command confirmations and error messages across different error scenarios\n\n**Automated TTS Test Cases:**\n- Enable TTS flag and verify audio output generation without errors\n- Test each supported TTS engine with fallback when primary engine fails\n- Validate configuration persistence for TTS settings across application restarts\n- Test TTS with special characters, long text, and multilingual content\n- Verify TTS integration doesn't interfere with normal command execution or file operations\n- Test concurrent TTS operations and resource management\n- Validate TTS accessibility compliance and user experience consistency\n</info added on 2025-06-14T21:55:53.499Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-14T22:07:04.840Z>\n**Duplicate Save Prevention Testing for TTS Implementation:**\n\nSince TTS functionality involves configuration persistence and potential concurrent operations, implement specific tests to prevent duplicate saves in the TTS context:\n\n- Test TTS configuration saves to prevent duplicate entries in configuration files when users rapidly change voice settings, volume, or other audio parameters\n- Validate that TTS engine initialization doesn't create duplicate configuration entries when switching between different TTS engines (Windows SAPI, macOS say, Linux espeak)\n- Test concurrent TTS operations to ensure audio output settings aren't duplicated when multiple commands with --tts flag run simultaneously\n- Verify that TTS preference saves are atomic and don't result in corrupted or duplicate configuration data during rapid user interactions\n- Implement unique constraint checks for TTS configuration entries to prevent duplicate voice profiles or audio settings\n- Test TTS configuration persistence across application restarts to ensure settings aren't duplicated on reload\n- Validate that TTS error logging doesn't create duplicate log entries when TTS engines fail or fallback mechanisms activate\n- Test edge cases where users rapidly toggle global TTS enable/disable settings to prevent duplicate configuration states\n- Ensure TTS-related task metadata (like audio output preferences per task) doesn't create duplicate entries in tasks.json\n- Implement locking mechanisms for TTS configuration file operations to prevent race conditions during concurrent access\n\nThis testing should be integrated with the existing TTS test strategy to ensure robust duplicate prevention across all TTS-related save operations.\n</info added on 2025-06-14T22:07:04.840Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-14T22:08:10.995Z>\n**Claude API Integration Testing for TTS Commands:**\n\nAdd specific testing requirements for Claude API integration within the TTS implementation context:\n\n- Test Claude API connectivity when generating TTS-enabled task content to ensure API calls don't interfere with audio output generation\n- Validate Claude API authentication and error handling when TTS commands request AI-generated content with --tts flag enabled\n- Test Claude API response parsing and integration with TTS output formatting to ensure AI-generated text is properly converted for speech synthesis\n- Verify Claude API token usage tracking doesn't conflict with TTS configuration persistence mechanisms\n- Test concurrent operations where Claude API calls and TTS audio generation occur simultaneously\n- Validate Claude API retry and backoff logic works correctly when TTS commands fail and need to regenerate content\n- Test Claude API integration with task generation workflows that include TTS output requirements\n- Ensure Claude API error messages are properly formatted for TTS output when --tts flag is enabled\n- Test Claude API model parameter configuration persistence alongside TTS configuration settings\n- Validate that Claude API failures gracefully fallback without breaking TTS functionality for existing task content\n- Test environment variable handling for ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in conjunction with TTS engine configuration\n- Verify Claude API integration logging doesn't create conflicts with TTS error logging mechanisms\n\nThis testing should ensure seamless integration between Claude API functionality and TTS features without interference or duplicate save issues.\n</info added on 2025-06-14T22:08:10.995Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-14T22:10:22.106Z>\n**Final Duplicate Save Testing Protocol - Research Session 6/14/2025:**\n\n**Comprehensive Test Environment Setup:**\n- Create clean test environment with known state of tasks.json and TTS configuration files\n- Back up current tasks.json, TTS settings, and Claude API configuration before testing\n- Ensure all TTS engines and Claude API connectivity are functional for comprehensive testing\n\n**Duplicate Save Test Scenarios for TTS Implementation:**\n- Test saving TTS configuration with identical voice settings to verify no duplicate entries\n- Attempt simultaneous TTS configuration saves while audio output is active\n- Test Claude API task generation with --tts flag to ensure no duplicate task entries in tasks.json\n- Validate TTS preference persistence doesn't create duplicate configuration entries during rapid setting changes\n- Test concurrent TTS operations with multiple commands to verify no duplicate audio output settings\n- Simulate race conditions between TTS configuration saves and Claude API calls\n\n**Manual and Automated Test Execution:**\n- Execute TTS commands with --tts flag while monitoring tasks.json for duplicate entries\n- Test Claude API integration with TTS-enabled commands to verify single task creation\n- Validate TTS configuration file integrity after multiple rapid setting changes\n- Test TTS error logging to ensure no duplicate log entries during engine failures\n- Verify TTS-related task metadata saves don't create duplicate entries\n\n**Edge Case Testing for TTS Context:**\n- Test TTS configuration saves with minor variations (case sensitivity, whitespace) in voice names\n- Validate duplicate detection with similar TTS settings across different engines\n- Test large-scale TTS operations to ensure performance and correctness\n- Verify TTS global enable/disable toggle doesn't create duplicate configuration states\n\n**Validation and Documentation:**\n- Monitor TTS configuration files, tasks.json, and logs for any duplicate entries\n- Document test results in provided table format with TTS-specific scenarios\n- Verify error handling provides clear feedback for TTS-related duplicate save attempts\n- Confirm regression testing covers all TTS functionality without introducing new duplicate save issues\n- Complete stakeholder confirmation before closing duplicate save testing for TTS implementation\n</info added on 2025-06-14T22:10:22.106Z>",

Task 9 implemented complete test coverage including unit tests for file-storage-lookup.test.ts covering single task retrieval performance and correctness, performance comparison tests measuring latency improvements, and comprehensive edge case validation. Production build artifacts successfully generated in dist/ directory with task-master.js and mcp-server.js. All core functionality validated through systematic testing across CLI commands, MCP server operations, and performance metrics collection. System ready for final production validation and performance documentation per targets: 70-90% I/O reduction, 50-80% faster single task retrieval, 20-30% smaller bundles.\n</info added on 2025-10-31T05:08:12.374Z>",

Implement platform-specific error handling for Windows EPERM (permission denied) and ENOENT (file not found) errors. Add proper error logging for debugging file locking issues. Focus on file storage adapter implementations.\n<info added on 2025-10-31T07:24:56.333Z>\nI'll analyze the codebase first to understand the current file storage and atomic write implementation before generating the update.Based on my analysis of the codebase, I found that the project already has well-established patterns for error handling, file operations, and retry logic in other modules. The file-operations.ts file at line 61 contains the performAtomicWrite method that needs the retry logic. Here's the comprehensive research findings that should be appended to the task:\n\n## CODEBASE RESEARCH FINDINGS - Testing Infrastructure Issues Integration\n\nThe investigation revealed critical testing infrastructure problems that directly impact the implementation and testing strategy for this atomic file write retry logic:\n\n### Primary Concern: Vitest Mocking Infrastructure Failures\nThe current test suite exhibits fundamental mocking pattern issues that will affect testing the retry functionality:\n\n1. **Module Mock Anti-Pattern**: Tests use `vi.mocked()` instead of proper `vi.mock()` declarations for Node.js built-in modules like fs/promises, causing `mockResolvedValue` and `mockRejectedValue` to be undefined in 50+ test files.\n\n2. **Constructor Mocking Failures**: Mock factories return object literals instead of proper constructor functions, leading to \"is not a constructor\" errors when testing dependency injection scenarios.\n\n### Implementation Location Analysis\nLocated the target implementation at `packages/tm-core/src/modules/storage/adapters/file-storage/file-operations.ts:61` in the `performAtomicWrite` method. The current implementation uses `fs.rename()` for atomic operations but lacks retry logic for Windows file locking scenarios.\n\n### Existing Retry Pattern Reference\nFound established retry/backoff patterns in `packages/tm-core/src/modules/ai/providers/base-provider.ts` with constants:\n- `DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES = 3`\n- `BASE_RETRY_DELAY_MS = 1000` \n- `BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER = 2`\n- `MAX_RETRY_DELAY_MS = 32000`\n\nThis provides a proven pattern to adapt for file operations with Windows-specific parameters (50ms base, 1000ms max).\n\n### Windows Error Handling Context\nThe codebase has extensive EPERM/ENOENT error handling patterns across multiple modules, particularly in config services and storage adapters, providing established patterns for platform-specific error classification.\n\n### Test Strategy Implications\nDue to the identified Vitest infrastructure issues, the test implementation must prioritize:\n1. **Proper fs.promises mocking setup** using `vi.mock('node:fs/promises')` instead of `vi.mocked()`\n2. **Fake timer implementation** for exponential backoff testing to avoid real delays\n3. **Platform detection mocking** for Windows-specific behavior testing\n4. **Error simulation patterns** that work with the corrected mocking infrastructure\n\nThe existing file-storage.spec.ts shows extensive testing patterns but suffers from the same mocking issues, requiring careful attention to ensure the retry logic tests don't exhibit similar problems. The test strategy should include validation that the retry helper works correctly with the current file locking mechanism in FileOperations while maintaining compatibility with the existing test infrastructure once the mocking issues are resolved.\n</info added on 2025-10-31T07:24:56.333Z>",

The codebase has pervasive Node.js built-in module mocking failures using vi.mocked(fs.readFile) patterns that require proper vi.mock('node:fs/promises') declarations to fix 50+ failing tests across config services.\n\n**Key Platform-Specific Risks Discovered:**\n- Windows file locking vulnerabilities (EPERM errors) already identified in packages/tm-core/src/modules/config/services/runtime-state-manager.service.ts with ENOENT handling\n- Missing Windows retry logic for atomic file operations despite atomic write interface defined in packages/tm-core/src/common/interfaces/storage.interface.ts\n- Constructor mocking anti-patterns preventing dependency injection testing in config-manager.spec.ts\n- Mixed test frameworks (Jest in root package.json, Vitest in individual packages) complicating cross-platform validation\n\n**Infrastructure Dependencies:**\nThe project uses individual package-level vitest.config.ts files (apps/cli, apps/mcp, packages/tm-core) requiring matrix strategy coordination. Root-level test scripts use Jest with coverage thresholds while package-level scripts use Vitest, necessitating unified cross-platform test execution strategies.\n\n**Implementation Priority Adjustments:**\nGiven the research findings, subtask 1 (Windows/Linux CI matrix) becomes critical for exposing platform-specific file system issues before implementing performance monitoring. The validation suite must address both the underlying mocking infrastructure problems and platform differences to achieve the target of 640 tests passing consistently on both platforms.\n</info added on 2025-10-31T07:18:06.395Z>",

The `loadSingleTask` method in FileStorage still references the old cache API (`this.taskCache.get`, `this.isCacheValid`, etc.) instead of using the new CacheManager architecture. Let me check the remaining methods that need migration.Let me examine the methods that still need migration to understand the exact scope of remaining work:Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can now generate the appropriate update for the subtask details:\n\nNext session tasks identified: loadSingleTask() method requires full migration to CacheManager API (line 259-310) - currently uses obsolete this.taskCache.get(), this.isCacheValid(), and this.taskCache.set() calls. saveTasks() method needs migration from this.invalidateCache() to this.invalidateCacheForTag(resolvedTag) (line 458). deleteTag() and renameTag() methods need migration from this.invalidateCache() to this.invalidateCacheForTag(tag) calls (lines 762, 769, 802, 819). All remaining methods properly use CacheManager for cache operations except these specific legacy API references.\n</info added on 2025-10-31T16:34:33.589Z>",
