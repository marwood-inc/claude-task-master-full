# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement GitHub API Integration Foundation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish core GitHub API communication layer with proper TypeScript types, authentication, and error handling using @octokit/rest
# Details:
Create GitHubClient class as abstraction over @octokit/rest for task-master specific operations. Implement CRUD operations for issues, labels, milestones, projects, and assignees. Handle authentication with GitHub tokens, rate limiting with exponential backoff, and proper error handling with typed exceptions. Include comprehensive type definitions for all GitHub entities (GitHubIssue, GitHubLabel, GitHubMilestone, SyncMapping, SyncConflict, SyncState, SyncOptions, SyncResult). Use @octokit/rest@^20.0.0 and @octokit/types@^12.0.0 for latest GitHub API support.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests with mocked Octokit, integration tests against test repository, error handling tests for authentication failures and rate limiting, round-trip tests for data integrity

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design GitHubClient Authentication and Core Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational authentication mechanism and core class structure for GitHub API interactions
### Details:
Implement authentication using GitHub token with support for both environment variable and configuration file. Create base GitHubClient class with constructor to initialize Octokit instance. Implement method to validate GitHub token and check API access. Set up error handling wrapper for Octokit methods with typed exceptions.

## 2. Implement Comprehensive GitHub Entity Type Definitions [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create detailed TypeScript type definitions for all GitHub-related entities used in task-master
### Details:
Define comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for GitHubIssue, GitHubLabel, GitHubMilestone, SyncMapping, SyncConflict, SyncState, SyncOptions, and SyncResult. Ensure type safety and complete coverage of GitHub API response structures. Use @octokit/types for base type definitions and extend with task-master specific requirements.

## 3. Implement GitHub CRUD Operations for Core Entities [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Develop methods for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for issues, labels, milestones, and projects
### Details:
Create methods in GitHubClient for CRUD operations on GitHub entities. Implement rate limiting with exponential backoff strategy. Add comprehensive error handling for network issues, authentication failures, and API constraints. Ensure methods support both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise environments.

## 4. Develop GitHub Field Mapping and Transformation Service [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Create bidirectional mapping between task-master data structures and GitHub Issue representations
### Details:
Implement GitHubFieldMapper with methods for converting between task-master internal models and GitHub issue format. Handle status mapping, priority translation to labels, and create rich markdown descriptions. Support different sync modes including checklist and separate issues for subtasks.

## 5. Implement Rate Limiting and Resilience Strategy [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.3
### Description: Create robust rate limiting, retry, and error handling mechanisms for GitHub API interactions
### Details:
Develop comprehensive rate limiting strategy with exponential backoff, circuit breaker pattern, and intelligent retry mechanisms. Implement logging for API interactions, create custom error classes for different failure scenarios. Add configurable timeout and retry count settings.
