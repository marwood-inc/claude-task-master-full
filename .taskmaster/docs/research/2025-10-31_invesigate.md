# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** invesigate

**Response:**

I need to understand what you'd like me to investigate. Your query simply says "invesigate" without specifying what aspect of the project or what particular issue you'd like me to research.

Looking at your project context, I can see this is a Task Master AI project with GitHub sync functionality. There are several areas that might warrant investigation:

## Potential Investigation Areas

**Current Tasks Status:**
- Several pending tasks related to error handling, service initialization, and conflict resolution
- High-priority task #13 addressing TODO comments in IntegrationDomain
- Medium-priority tasks around configuration validation and conflict resolution

**Recent Implementation:**
- GitHub API integration foundation (completed)
- GitHub field mapping service (completed) 
- GitHub configuration management (completed)

**Potential Investigation Topics:**

1. **Error Handling Issues** - Task #17 mentions CLI commands catch errors generically and need specific handling for different error types

2. **Code Quality Issues** - Tasks #14-16 highlight duplication in service initialization, placeholder values, and validation logic

3. **TODO Comments** - Task #13 specifically calls out multiple TODO items in integration-domain.ts that need implementation

4. **Integration Status** - The project has comprehensive GitHub sync documentation suggesting recent major implementation work

Could you please clarify what specific aspect you'd like me to investigate? For example:
- A particular error or issue you're encountering
- Code quality concerns in a specific area
- Implementation status of certain features
- Architecture decisions for the GitHub sync functionality
- Performance or testing concerns

This will help me provide a focused and actionable research response.
