			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Conflict Detection and Resolution",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down conflict detection into detection algorithms, interactive UI components, auto-resolution strategies, validation layers, service orchestration, and comprehensive logging. Each component should handle specific conflict scenarios with proper error handling and user feedback.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to bidirectional sync conflict handling, interactive resolution UI, multiple resolution strategies, and the need for robust undo functionality. Involves complex state management and user interaction patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Two-Way Sync with Conflict Handling",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into state service core functionality, change detection mechanisms, conflict resolver integration, remote pull implementation, and local push synchronization. Focus on atomic operations, error handling, and data consistency throughout the bidirectional sync process.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity as this is the core bidirectional sync functionality. Requires coordination of multiple services, atomic operations, conflict resolution integration, and handling of partial failures while maintaining data integrity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Advanced GitHub Features",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into milestone CRUD operations, GitHub Projects board integration, and assignee management. Each should include feature flags, validation, and support for both GitHub.com and Enterprise configurations.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to multiple GitHub API integrations (milestones, projects, assignees), but these are mostly independent features with existing patterns in the codebase. Feature flags and enterprise support add some complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement GitHub Configuration Management",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into token validation/authentication, interactive configuration command design, and configuration storage service. Focus on security, user experience, and integration with existing configuration patterns.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving secure credential handling, interactive CLI design, and configuration persistence. Builds on existing patterns in the CLI and configuration systems, but requires careful security considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement CLI Commands and User Interface",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into command structure definition, progress tracking/feedback systems, core sync logic implementation, and CLI registration/configuration. Follow established CLI patterns while adding GitHub-specific functionality.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to multiple CLI commands with various options, progress tracking, and integration with existing CLI patterns. Requires good UX design and comprehensive option handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Extend Integration Domain Facade",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into method signature design, core logic implementation, and constructor/configuration updates. Ensure clean integration with existing export functionality and maintain backward compatibility.",
			"reasoning": "Lower-moderate complexity as it's primarily extending an existing facade class with new methods. The existing IntegrationDomain pattern provides a clear template, and GitHub services are already implemented."
