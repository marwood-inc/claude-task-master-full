			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Implement GitHub API Integration Foundation",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down GitHub API integration into core components: authentication, CRUD operations, type definitions, error handling, and rate limiting strategies",
			"reasoning": "Extremely complex task involving multiple sophisticated aspects of API integration. Requires deep understanding of GitHub API, robust TypeScript typing, comprehensive error handling, and performance considerations with rate limiting. Multiple integration points, complex type definitions, and need for extensive testing make this a high-complexity architectural foundation."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement GitHub Field Mapping Service",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose field mapping into status conversion, priority mapping, description enrichment, and subtask handling strategies",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to semantic preservation requirements across different task management systems. Involves intricate transformation logic, handling multiple mapping scenarios, preserving metadata, and supporting different subtask representation modes. Requires careful design to maintain data integrity and meaningful translations."
