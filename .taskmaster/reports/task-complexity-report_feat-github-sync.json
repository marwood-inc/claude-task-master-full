			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Automate Task Master Specialist Delegation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Task Master specialist automation into: 1) Updating specialist brief for background agent behavior with standardized templates and authoritative references, 2) Creating background agent descriptor JSON with CLI triggers and tag matching, 3) Registering automation in settings and updating documentation, 4) Implementing tag-driven routing hooks in tm-bridge with delegation metadata emission, and 5) Adding comprehensive Vitest coverage for trigger matching and CLI routing",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to: Cross-cutting concerns across multiple layers (.claude config, tm-bridge, CLI metadata), complex delegation routing logic, integration with existing agent infrastructure, and comprehensive testing requirements. Requires deep understanding of Claude Code background agent architecture and Task Master's tag-based routing system."

		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Type Assertion in IntegrationDomain",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Analyzing CLI and core subtask mode enum types to understand the mismatch and document expected values, and 2) Implementing a safe type mapper utility to translate CLI-submitted modes to SubtaskSyncMode enum with proper error handling and unit test coverage",
			"reasoning": "Medium-low complexity. Straightforward type safety fix requiring enum mapping between CLI and core layers. Code analysis shows clear 'as any' assertion on line 187 that needs proper typing. Follows established patterns in the codebase for type translation between presentation and core layers."

			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Address TODO Comments in IntegrationDomain",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Auditing all TODOs in integration-domain.ts to document requirements and blocking issues, 2) Implementing two-way sync orchestration in IntegrationDomain without throwing, 3) Integrating GitHubSyncStateService helpers for status data access, 4) Surfacing detailed conflict information in getGitHubSyncStatus, 5) Computing unmapped tasks and change detection metrics, and 6) Writing comprehensive regression tests for new sync and status flows",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to: Multiple interconnected TODOs affecting core sync functionality, requires implementing bidirectional sync logic, state service integration, conflict handling, and comprehensive testing. Analysis shows 4 TODO comments spanning lines 202, 369, 383, and 386-387 affecting critical sync operations."

		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Refactor GitHub Configuration Validation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Inventorying all GitHub validation usage patterns across IntegrationDomain methods to identify duplication, 2) Implementing a reusable private validateGitHubConfiguration helper with configurable token checks and migrating all callers, and 3) Updating unit tests to cover the shared validator and maintaining existing behavior",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity refactoring task. Code analysis shows validation duplication across syncWithGitHub, resolveConflict, getGitHubSyncStatus and other methods. Straightforward extraction pattern but requires careful testing to ensure no regressions in validation behavior."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Improve Conflict Resolution Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Wiring GitHubSyncStateService to fetch real ConflictInfo records replacing hardcoded issueNumber: 0, 2) Mapping CLI strategy strings to typed domain enum values with validation, 3) Passing fully populated ConflictInfo and validated strategy enums into resolveConflict removing 'any' types, and 4) Adding integration tests for end-to-end conflict resolution scenarios",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to: Placeholder implementation needs service integration, type mapping between CLI and domain layers, removing unsafe 'any' types, and comprehensive testing. Code shows hardcoded issueNumber: 0 and strategy as any on lines 278-287."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Refactor Service Initialization Duplication",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Cataloging all duplicated service initialization patterns across integration-domain.ts methods, 2) Designing a shared lazy initialization helper or factory method for GitHub services that handles dependency injection and configuration, and 3) Refactoring all identified methods to use the shared helper while maintaining existing behavior",
			"reasoning": "Low-medium complexity refactoring. Code analysis shows clear duplication patterns in lines 144-179, 248-270, 340-355 for GitHubSyncStateService, GitHubConfigService creation. Standard factory pattern implementation with straightforward testing requirements."

		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Specific Error Handling in CLI Commands",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Designing error classification strategy using TaskMasterError taxonomy for validation vs network vs transient failures with exit code mapping, 2) Implementing command-level error handling updates in sync, configure, and status commands with retry prompts and specific messaging, and 3) Creating automated regression tests for differentiated error flows and exit codes",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity due to: Designing error classification system, updating multiple CLI commands with differentiated handling, implementing retry logic for transient failures, and comprehensive test coverage. Requires understanding existing TaskMasterError taxonomy and CLI error handling patterns."
