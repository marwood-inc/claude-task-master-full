			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Automate Task Master Specialist Delegation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate the work into documentation updates, background-agent configuration/schema, CLI metadata changes, tm-bridge routing logic, automated test coverage, and verification steps for settings/formatting.",
			"reasoning": "Automation touches multi-layer artifacts—the specialist brief needs major expansion `.claude/agents/task-master-specialist.md:1`, background-agent JSON is greenfield because `.claude/background-agents/` is absent, CLI metadata must tag verbs `apps/cli/src/command-registry.ts:17`, and tm-bridge needs delegation hooks plus metadata emission `packages/tm-bridge/src/update-bridge.ts:93`; new Vitest coverage under `packages/tm-bridge/src/` and CLI smoke checks add further effort."

			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Type Assertion in IntegrationDomain",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Review the subtask mode types used by the CLI and core sync service, then implement a safe mapping plus adjust typings/tests accordingly.",
			"reasoning": "`IntegrationDomain.syncWithGitHub` still coerces `subtaskMode` with `as any` `packages/tm-core/src/modules/integration/integration-domain.ts:187` because the CLI surfaces `'separate-issues'` while the sync layer expects `SubtaskSyncMode` `'separate_issues'` `packages/tm-core/src/modules/integration/types/github-sync-state-types.ts:238`; adding a mapper while keeping CLI option parsing compatible `apps/cli/src/commands/github/sync.command.ts:33` is a contained change."

		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Address TODO Comments in IntegrationDomain",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Plan subtasks for enabling two-way sync dispatch, enriching sync status (conflicts, unmapped tasks, change counts), wiring state/service helpers, and adding regression tests for these flows.",
			"reasoning": "The domain currently throws for two-way sync `packages/tm-core/src/modules/integration/integration-domain.ts:201` despite `GitHubSyncService.syncWithGitHub` providing pull/push orchestration `packages/tm-core/src/modules/integration/services/github-sync.service.ts:1263`; status reporting leaves TODOs for conflicts and change counts `packages/tm-core/src/modules/integration/integration-domain.ts:369`/`383`/`386` even though `GitHubSyncStateService` exposes conflict lists and change metadata `packages/tm-core/src/modules/integration/services/github-sync-state.service.ts:262`/`395`; stitching these together and validating edge cases demands significant coordination and tests."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Refactor GitHub Configuration Validation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Catalog every spot in IntegrationDomain that validates GitHub settings, design a reusable helper with optional checks (token vs repo), update the callers, and adjust unit tests.",
			"reasoning": "The same guard clauses for enabled, owner, repo, and token appear in several entry points—`syncWithGitHub` `packages/tm-core/src/modules/integration/integration-domain.ts:113`, `resolveConflict` `:237`, and `getGitHubSyncStatus` `:321`; extracting them into a private validator while preserving tailored error messages and differing requirements (token optional in status) adds moderate refactoring effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Improve Conflict Resolution Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline subtasks to load real conflict details from state, map CLI strategies to domain enums, pass rich ConflictInfo into the resolver, and cover the flow with tests.",
			"reasoning": "`resolveConflict` currently fabricates a stub `conflictInfo: any` with `issueNumber: 0` `packages/tm-core/src/modules/integration/integration-domain.ts:276`, yet the resolver expects structured `ConflictInfo` objects `packages/tm-core/src/modules/integration/types/github-conflict-types.ts:241`; stitching in `GitHubSyncStateService.getConflicts` `packages/tm-core/src/modules/integration/services/github-sync-state.service.ts:262` and translating simplified strategy strings into domain-level enums requires new plumbing and validation logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Refactor Service Initialization Duplication",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Identify duplicated service instantiations, design a caching or factory helper, update the methods to reuse it, and validate lifecycle behavior.",
			"reasoning": "Creating `GitHubSyncStateService`, `GitHubConfigService`, and `ConflictResolutionService` is repeated across sync and status flows—see `packages/tm-core/src/modules/integration/integration-domain.ts:150`, `:253`, `:345`, and `:517`; consolidating these into lazy singletons must preserve per-repo options while reducing repetition, which is a moderate refactor."

		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Specific Error Handling in CLI Commands",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break the work into error classification design (leveraging TaskMasterError codes), command-level handling updates with exit codes/retry prompts, and automated tests documenting the new behavior.",
			"reasoning": "GitHub CLI commands fallback to a blanket catch-and-exit pattern—`sync` `apps/cli/src/commands/github/sync.command.ts:180`, `configure` `apps/cli/src/commands/github/configure.command.ts:274`, `status` `apps/cli/src/commands/github/status.command.ts:127`—while the shared handler `apps/cli/src/utils/error-handler.ts:21` ignores `TaskMasterError` codes `packages/tm-core/src/common/errors/task-master-error.ts:19`; adding differentiated handling for network vs validation paths and user prompts requires coordinated updates and regression coverage."
